/*
    *** Vertical Formatting ***
        => Vertical space of our code file.
        => Code should be readable like an essay - top to bottom withour too many "jumps"
        => if our file becomes too big, it houses too many different concepts, we wanna consider splitting
         it across multiple files. there is no rule regualtion how many code one file, but for example, 
         multiple classes beign defined in one file, then it is probably too big and we should split our 
         file into multiple files.One file is one class it is good rule.
        => Different concepts ("areas") should be seperated by spacing. for example, 
        simply multiple methods within one at the same class.vertical black line
        => Similar concepts ("area") should not be separated by spacing.
        => Related concept should be kept close to each other.
        => Order things: public properties -> private properties -> public methods -> private methods

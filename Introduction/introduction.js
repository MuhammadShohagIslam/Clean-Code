/*
    *** Waht is Clean-Code ***
        => It's not about whether code works or not, instead it's about whether code is esay to read and understand.
        => Code should be readable and meaningful
        => Code should reduce cognitive load, you have to go
         through, so that we have less congnitive load, and 
         undertanding is easy.
        => Should be concise and 'to the point'
        => Should avoid unintutive names, complex nesting and big code blocks.
        => Should follow common best practice and patterns.
        => Should be fun to write and to maintain.

    Note: Clean code is easy to understand and Dirty code is not easy to understand.

/*
    *** Key Pain Points of the Clean code ***

        Names: Variable, Functions, Classes
        Structure & Comments: Code Formatting, Good and Bad Comments
        Functions: Length, Parameters
        Conditions and Error Handling: Deep Nesting, Missing Error Handling.
        Classes and Data Structure: Missing Distinction, Bloated Classes

    Above Solution: Rules and Concepts, Patterns and Principles, Text-Driven-Development.

/*
    *** Clean code does not require strong typing ***
        => Types can help preventing error and can improve readability.
        => But code can also 100% readable and meaningful without types.

/*
    *** Clean Code Vs Clean Architecture ***
                    Clean Code
            => How to write the code
            => Focus on single problems / files

                Clean Architecture 
            => It about how structure our project
            => How we seperate our entities
            => How we store our data
            => Focus on the project as a whole.
            Note: where to write which code. Do we use dependency injection or not?

    *** Clean Code Vs Pattern and Principles ***
                    Clean Code
            => Write code which is readable and esay to understand

                    Patterns and Principles
            => Write code which is maintainable and extensible.
            => If you name things poorly, format things poorly,
            functions which are super clunky and messed up and hard to read

*/

/*
    *** The way of Clean Code ***
    => We will always find ways of improving our code => As our project elvolves and changes, our code will need to change

    Note: Question old code and refactor a lot!
